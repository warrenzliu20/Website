<div class="AboutMe">
  <p>I was born in Boise, Idaho but I grew up in Austin, Texas. My parents grew up in China so, during my childhood, we would often go back to China. Every time we go back, I get filled with excitement because we visit all the places I've been to when I was young. My interests in math and science started in middle school when I attended Kealing Middle School. I took classes such as geometry, algebra II, genetics, etc. High school is where I was first introduced to computer science. What drew me to computer science was the limitless applications that it has. Now, at Texas A&M, I enjoy computer science classes and try to attend a lot of <a href="https://tamuhack.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none"><font color="blue">hackathons</font></a> and programming competitions. At first, I couldn't choose between hardware or software since I enjoyed both, so I chose the middle ground for my major, computer engineering. Computer engineering to me is the best of both worlds since I can program and see the direct effect it has on the hardware in front of me. My other main interests are music, video games, ping pong,  and working out. I started playing trombone in middle school. Only recently have I stopped playing due to time conflicts, but I plan to start once I graduate. Like programming, music is endless. I love the creativity that music has and how unique it is to be a part of a band. I play video games and ping pong as a way to destress from school since I find them both enjoyable. I also like to volunteer during my free time. In high school, I spent my summers volunteering at the Texas State Summer Autism Camp. At Texas A&M, I have participated in Big Event where the students give back to the community.
